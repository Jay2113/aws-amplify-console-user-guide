# To add a custom domain managed by GoDaddy<a name="to-add-a-custom-domain-managed-by-godaddy"></a>

1. Follow steps one through six of the procedures [To add a custom domain managed by a third\-party DNS provider](to-add-a-custom-domain-managed-by-a-third-party-dns-provider.md)\.

1. Log in to your GoDaddy account\. In your list of domains, find the domain to add and choose **DNS**\. GoDaddy displays a list of records for your domain\. You will add two new CNAME records\.

1. Create the first CNAME record to point your subdomains to the Amplify domain\. For **Host**, enter only the subdomain\. For example, if your subdomain is *www\.example\.com*, enter *www* for **Host**\. The value that you enter for **Points to** is available by viewing your DNS records in the Amplify console\. If the Amplify console displays the domain for your app as *xxxxxxxxxxxxxx\.cloudfront\.net*, then enter *xxxxxxxxxxxxxx\.cloudfront\.net* for **Points to**\. The following screenshot shows a correctly configured CNAME record for subdomains\.

1. Create the second CNAME record to point to the Amazon Certificate Manager \(ACM\) validation server\. A single validated ACM generates an SSL certificate for your domain\. For **Host**, enter the subdomain and for **Points to** enter the ACM validation certificate\. For example, if the DNS record in the Amplify console for verifying ownership of your subdomain is *\_c3e2d7eaf1e656b73f46cd6980fdc0e\.example\.com*, enter only *\_c3e2d7eaf1e656b73f46cd6980fdc0e* for **Host**\. If the validation server is *\_68126cb4e8b7ab90c515ea3edb5be60d\.hkvuiqjoua\.acm\-validations\.aws*, enter *\_68126cb4e8b7ab90c515ea3edb5be60d\.hkvuiqjoua\.acm\-validations\.aws* for **Points to**\. The following screenshot shows a correctly configured CNAME record for the validation certificate\.

1. GoDaddy doesn’t support ANAME/ALIAS records\. For DNS providers that do not have ANAME/ALIAS support, we strongly recommend migrating your DNS to Amazon Route 53\. For more information, see [Configuring Amazon Route 53 as your DNS service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-configuring.html)\. If you want to keep GoDaddy as your provider and update the root domain, add **Forwarding** and set up a domain forward\. Locate the **Forwarding** box at the bottom of the DNS Management page\. For **Forward to**, choose **http://**\. Enter the name of your subdomain to foward to, such as *www\.example\.com*\. For **Forward Type** choose **Temporary \(302\)**\. For **Settings** choose **Forward only**\. The following screenshot displays the correct **Forwarding** values\.
