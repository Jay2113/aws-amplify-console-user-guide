# Conditional backend builds<a name="conditional-backends"></a>

Amplify now supports conditional backend builds on all branches in an app\. To configure conditional backend builds, set the `AMPLIFY_DIFF_BACKEND` environment variable to `true`\. Enabling conditional backend builds will help speed up builds where changes are made only to the frontend\.

When you enable diff based backend builds, at the start of each build, Amplify attempts to run a diff on the `amplify` folder in your repository\. If Amplify doesn't find any differences, it skips the backend build step, and doesn't update your backend resources\. If your project doesn't have an `amplify` folder in your repository, Amplify ignores the value of the `AMPLIFY_DIFF_BACKEND` environment variable\. For instructions on setting the `AMPLIFY_DIFF_BACKEND` environment variable, see [Enable or disable diff based backend builds](build-settings.md#enable-diff-backend)\.
