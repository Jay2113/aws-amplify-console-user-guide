1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the [Amplify Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/)\.

1. Choose your app that you want to connect to a custom domain\.

1. In the Navigation pane, choose **App Settings**, **Domain management**, and then in the **Domain management** page, choose **Add domain**\. The following screenshot shows the Domain management section where you choose to add a custom domain\.

1. For **Domain**, enter your root domain\. For example, if the name of your domain is *https://example\.com*, enter *example\.com* for **Domain**\. As you start typing, any root domains that you already manage in RouteÂ 53 appear in the list\. Select the domain you want to use and then choose **Configure Domain**\. The following screenshot shows the Domain magagement section with a domain name appearing in the list

1. By default, the Amplify console automatically creates two subdomain entries for your domain\. For example, if your domain name is *example\.com*, you will see the subdomains *https://www\.example\.com* and *https://example\.com* with a redirect set up from the root domain to the *www* subdomain\. You can change this by choosing **Rewrites and redirects** from the Navigation pane\. You can modify the default configuration if you want to add subdomains only\. For more information, see [To add a subdomain only](to-manage-subdomains.md#to-add-a-subdomain-only)\. Choose **Save** after configuring your domain\. The following screenshot shows the Add domain section with two automatically created subdomain entries\.

**Note**  
 It can take up to 24 hours for the DNS to propagate and to issue the SSL certificate\. For help with resolving errors that occur, see [Troubleshooting custom domains](troubleshooting-custom-domains.md)\.
